# Welcome

This is where it all starts, your first path page. This page is your chance to make a great first impression. So let your personality come through and make sure to tell the learners why your page is worth their time.

The best way to keep your learners' attention is with a crisp description of what your path is all about. In our case, it's to let you get started with creating your own learning paths as fast as possible. The target audience is anyone wanting to share amazing learning resources with other devs on a platform specifically built  to let your content sing.

Next, it's good to highlight what learners should get out of your course. After going through this path, you will be able to:

* Fork a template GitHub repository
* Publish your own path into Outlearn
* Add enhancements such as tasks or unfurled links

Make sure to set the right expectations about time and effort as well. Reviewing this path will take about 5 minutes. If you decide to start working on your own path, there's no telling how much time will pass before you even notice!

No matter what kind of a role you are in, you are most likely teaching people. That includes on-boarding a new colleague, mentoring a junior developer, managing a team, or spreading the word about an open source project. We bet that we can make it easier for you to do some of that teaching. Why not give it a try.

Cheers,
Outlearn Team
