# What is this page?

This is a placeholder Learning Module for you to customize.  Look in the `my-outlearn-module.md` to see how it is coded up, and then start editing away with your own content.

### Using Markdown

You may have already used Markdown. It's an awesome format for technical publishing. If you need a refresher, GitHub has a great overview.

<!-- @link, "url" : "https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/", "text": "I know enough about Markdown." -->

GitHub-flavored markdown will work just fine, and you can preview your files in your favorite text editor or Markdown preview tool before uploading them to Outlearn for final proof-reading.

If you want to enrich your content with more features, this sample module has a few examples, including the Unfurled Link above, and the interactive features described in the next section.

# Let's make our module Fancy

If you want to get your audience to practice what you preach, give them a task.

```python
# Transpose a matrix:
>>> l = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> zip(*l)
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]

# Divide a list into groups of n:
>>> l = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8]
>>> zip(*[iter(l)] * 3)
[(3, 1, 4), (1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 5), (3, 5, 8)]
```

And if they are making something worth sharing, why not let them share it with you?

<!-- @task, "hasDeliverable" : true, "text" : "Write and submit a haiku about your favorite compiler."-->
