# What Are You Going to Do About It?

If you want to get your audience to practice what you preach, give them a task.

<!-- @task, "content" : "Don't just stand there, do something!"-->

And if they are making something worth sharing, why not let them share it with you?

<!-- @task, "content" : "Write a haiku about your favorite compiler", "deliverable" : "Post your poem here."-->

# Tell Me How You Really Feel

At the end of a module, Outlearn asks learners how confident they are in the things you taught them. It gives them a chance to think about their learning which usually makes the learning stick better. And it gives great feedback on how well your module is doing.
